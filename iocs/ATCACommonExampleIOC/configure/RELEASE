# RELEASE - Location of external support modules
#
# IF YOU CHANGE ANY PATHS in this file or make API changes to
# any modules it refers to, you should do a "make rebuild" in
# this application's top level directory.
#
# The EPICS build process does not check dependencies against
# any files from outside the application, so it is safest to
# rebuild it completely if any modules it depends on change.
#
# Host- or target-specific settings can be given in files named
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).Common
#  RELEASE.Common.$(T_A)
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).$(T_A)
#
# This file is parsed by both GNUmake and an EPICS Perl script,
# so it may ONLY contain definititions of paths to other support
# modules, variable definitions that are used in module paths,
# and include statements that pull in other RELEASE files.
# Variables may be used before their values have been set.
# Build variables that are NOT used in paths should be set in
# the CONFIG_SITE file.

# Read definitions of:
#       EPICS_SITE_TOP
#       BASE_MODULE_VERSION
#       EPICS_MODULES
# from one of the following options
-include $(TOP)/RELEASE_SITE
-include $(TOP)/../../RELEASE_SITE
-include $(TOP)/../../../../RELEASE_SITE

# Check that EPICS_MODULES was defined in a RELEASE_SITE file
-include $(TOP)/../../RELEASE_SITE.check

# Variables and paths to dependent modules:
YAMLLOADER_VERSION=R2.1.0
YAMLDOWNLOADER_MODULE_VERSION=R1.2.0
ASYN_MODULE_VERSION=R4.32-1.0.0

#MODULES = /path/to/modules
YAMLLOADER=$(EPICS_MODULES)/yamlLoader/$(YAMLLOADER_VERSION)
YAMLDOWNLOADER=$(EPICS_MODULES)/yamlDownloader/$(YAMLDOWNLOADER_MODULE_VERSION)
ASYN=$(EPICS_MODULES)/asyn/$(ASYN_MODULE_VERSION)
ATCACOMMON = $(TOP)/../..

# If using the sequencer, point SNCSEQ at its top directory:
#SNCSEQ = $(MODULES)/seq-ver

# EPICS_BASE should appear last so earlier modules can override stuff:
EPICS_BASE = /afs/slac/g/lcls/epics/base/R7.0.3.1-1.0

# Set RULES here if you want to use build rules from somewhere
# other than EPICS_BASE:
#RULES = $(MODULES)/build-rules

# These lines allow developers to override these RELEASE settings
# without having to modify this file directly.
