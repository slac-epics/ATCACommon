The IOC shell function atcaCheckFirmwareVersion receives a list of strings
containing the firmware versions that are compatible with the IOC. Once the
function is called, it reads the firmware data from the registers fpgaVersion
and gitHash and compares with each of the strings from the function arguments. 

If all of the strings mismatch the firmware version, two outcomes are possible:
- print a warning message on the shell.
- print the warning message and exit the IOC.

The function has this format:
atcaCheckFirmwareVersion [Stop IOC? Y/N] [any number of desired gitHash or fpgaVersion, each item between quotes]

Example:
atcaCheckFirmwareVersion "Y" "879c14487f9f78a7f369190b260f2ea295f106d6" "50528256" "0x3030000" 

If using the fpgaVersion in hexadecimal format, 0x is required in the beginning
of the number. In the example above, "50528256" decimal is equal to "0x3030000",
so the same result would be obtained with either one or the other.

The example IOC found in iocs/firmwareVersionCheckExampleIOC contains all the
necessary modules and packages to connect to an ATCA crate and have the IOC
started as atcaCheckFirmwareVersion can be run. Please, use this IOC example's
configure/RELEASE, configure/CONFIG_SITE*, Makefiles, and st.cmd as a reference
for your own IOC.
