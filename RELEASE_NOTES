                 all in one PV of type double.

                 configures the DaQMux and the waveform engine.
               - Removed exposure of several firmware specific PVs:
                 - DaqMux buffer size
                 - Waveform engine enable, mode, msgdst
                   startAddr, endAddr, wrAddr, frameAfter Trigger

R1.6.0:        11-15-2021  Marcio Donadio
               - Created function atcaCheckFirmwareVersion that checks if
                 the firmware version is compatible with what the IOC
                 expects.
               - Created an IOC example - iocs/firmwareVersionCheckExampleIOC -
                 to make it easier for an engineer to bring the function to an
                 IOC.
               - Brought back asyn version R4.32-1.0.0 as most of the modules
                 were still not built agains R4.39-1.0.0. During this
                 transition period, I'll create R1.6.1 with an updated asyn.

R1.5.1:        10-11-2021  M. Dunning

               - ATCACommon class can now be inherited by other modules that
                 wants to process an application specific debug stream.
               - Placed try-catch and if in various parts of the code to improve
                 protection against segmentation fault.
               - Fixed bug where an user calling the debug stream configure
                 function without 4 stream stings would generate a segmentation
                 fault.
               - Multi callback functions can now be created per stream channel.
               - New function cpswDebugStreamDump to print contents of the stream
                 debug on the IOC shell.
               - Created README contents.
